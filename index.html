                        Computational geometry is a subfield of computer science that deals primarily with "the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for problems involving geometric input and output" (<a href="#Mount">Mount</a>). Computational geometry uses the known properties of geometric objects, typically in two dimensions and three dimensions, to find efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems. These problems range from problems in robotics, computer vision, and pathfinding to less obviously geometric problems such as finding an optimal solution under a system of linear constraints, time series analysis, and machine learning (<a href="#Mount">Mount</a>).
                        <br><br>
                        One of the primary goals of computational geometry is to provide fundamental, geometric tools that can be applied to solve problems in a wide array of scenarios (<a href="#Mount">Mount</a>). Many problems in mathematics and computer science can be reduced to common problems in computational geometry such as finding the shortest path on a graph, finding the convex hull of a set of points, polygonal triangulation, and linear programming (<a href="#Mount">Mount</a>). One such common problem in computational geometry is computing the visibility graph of a given input graph.

                        In order to understand visibility graphs, we must first have a notion of what it means for two points to be visible to one another. Given a graph <span class="code">G = (V, L)</span> where <span class="code">V &sube; &reals; &times; &reals;</span> is a set of points in a 2-D plane and <span class="code">L &sube; {(u,v) &mid; u in V &and; v in V &and; u &NotEqual; v}</span> is a set of non-intersecting "obstacle" line segments in the plane, we say that any two points <span class="code">a,b in V</span> are visible to one another if you can draw a line segment connecting <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> that does not intersect a line segment in <span class="code">L</span> (<a href="#Mount">Mount</a>).

We also include the original line segment obstacles in our visibility graph. Therefore, the graph <span class="code">G<sub>v</sub> = (V, E &Union; L)</span> is the visibility graph of <span class="code">G</span>.

                        The reason why we choose to include the edges of the obstacles in our graph is because one of the most common uses of visibility graphs is finding the Euclidean shortest path between two points given a series of obstacles in between them. Once the visibility graph of a graph <span class="code">G = (V, L)</span> has been created, a well known algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search can be used to find the shortest path between the two vertices on the graph (<a href="#Coleman">Coleman</a>). We include the edges of the obstacles to allow for the case where the shortest path involves "walking" along the "wall" of an obstacle.

                    Currently, the best known algorithm for computing the visibility graph of an input graph with <span class="code">n</span> vertices has a time complexity of <span class="code">O(n log n + k)</span> where <span class="code">k</span> represents the number of edges in the visibility graph (<a href="#Mount">Mount</a>). In the worst case, every vertex in the visibility graph is visible to every other vertex and <span class="code">k = O(n<sup>2</sup>)</span> which results in a total worst case runtime of <span class="code">O(n log n + n<sup>2</sup>) = O(n<sup>2</sup>)</span>. However, since this algorithm is fairly complex and not very intuitive, we will take a closer look at a more intuitive <span class="code">O(n<sup>2</sup> log n)</span> algorithm discovered by D. T. Lee in 1978 (<a href="#Kitzinger">Kitzinger</a>).<br><br>

                    The algorithm iterates through each vertex <span class="code">V[i]</span> in an input graph <span class="code">G = (V, L)</span> and performs two main steps at each vertex. First, we create a "scan line" centered at the vertex <span class="code">V[i]</span> that points directly to the right of <span class="code">V[i]</span>. We then iterate through every vertex <span class="code">V[j]</span> in <span class="code">V</span> such that <span class="code">V[i] &NotEqual; V[j]</span> and calculate the counter-clockwise angle between the scan line and <span class="code">V[j]</span>. We store these values in a data structure <span class="code">S</span> making sure to sort them in increasing order.<br><br>
                    
                    Then, we iterate through each <span class="code">V[j]</span> in <span class="code">S</span> and move our scan line to point to <span class="code">V[j]</span>. If our scan line intersects with any other edges, we add the intersection point to a data structure <span class="code">T</span> making sure to sort them by distance to <span class="code">V[i]</span>. If there are no edges between <span class="code">V[i]</span> and <span class="code">V[j]</span>, then we know <span class="code">V[i]</span> is visible to <span class="code">V[j]</span>. Otherwise, if the closest intersection point (i.e. the first element of <span class="code">T</span>) is equivalent to <span class="code">V[j]</span>, then we also know <span class="code">V[i]</span> is visible to <span class="code">V[j]</span>. We repeat this process for every vertex in <span class="code">V</span>, making sure to store visible pairs of vertices in a data structure <span class="code">E</span>. At the end of the algorithm we return <span class="code">G<sub>v</sub> = (V, E &Union; L)</span> and find that this graph is our visibility graph for <span class="code">G</span>!
